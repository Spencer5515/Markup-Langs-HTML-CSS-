                    During her time as a computer, she also worked in Langely's Fligth Research Division with a staff of white male engineers and, as a result, had to stand her ground and work hard to make a name for herself both as a woman and an African-American.</li>
                    <li class="life-list"><strong>1957</strong> - Johnsons provides some of the mathematics for a document known as <em>Notes on Space Technology</em> which combined a series of lectures by engineers in various divisions at NACA.</li>
